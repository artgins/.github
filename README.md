[Yuneta Simplified](https://doc.yuneta.io) is a development framework focused on messaging and services, 
based on Event-driven, Automata-based and Object-oriented programming paradigms. 
Heavy use of JSON, serie-time, key-value, flat-files and graphs concepts.

## Implementation Overview

The initial approach to this concept was developed in Python:
- [GinsFSM](https://pythonhosted.org/ginsfsm/)

It was later implemented in C:
- [gobj-ecosistema](https://github.com/gobj-ecosistema)
- [yuneta](https://github.com/yuneta)
- [yuno-store](https://github.com/yuno-store)

**Important:** While the underlying concepts remain the same, the current versionâ€™s API is incompatible with previous versions.  
It is currently written in C, with plans for JavaScript and Python implementations.
