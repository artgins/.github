## Hi there 👋

`Yuneta Simplified` is a development framework focused on messaging and services. 
It leverages event-driven, automata-based, and object-oriented programming paradigms, 
making heavy use of JSON, real-time data, key-value structures, flat files, and graph concepts.

## Implementation Overview

The initial approach to this concept was developed in Python:
- [GinsFSM](https://pythonhosted.org/ginsfsm/)

It is now being redesigned in [YunetaS](https://github.com/artgins/yunetas).

Documentation is available in [Yuneta Simplified](https://doc.yuneta.io).

**Important:** While the underlying concepts remain the same, the current version’s API is incompatible with previous versions.

Although it is currently written in C, there are plans to implement it in JavaScript and Python.
