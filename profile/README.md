## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[Yuneta Simplified](https://doc.yuneta.io) is a development framework focused on messaging and services. 
It leverages event-driven, automata-based, and object-oriented programming paradigms, 
making heavy use of JSON, real-time data, key-value structures, flat files, and graph concepts.

## Implementation Overview

The initial approach to this concept was developed in Python:
- [GinsFSM](https://pythonhosted.org/ginsfsm/)

It was later implemented in C:
- [gobj-ecosistema](https://github.com/gobj-ecosistema)
- [yuneta](https://github.com/yuneta)
- [yuno-store](https://github.com/yuno-store)

It is now being redesigned in [YunetaS](https://github.com/artgins/yunetas).

**Important:** While the underlying concepts remain the same, the current versionâ€™s API is incompatible with previous versions.

Although it is currently written in C, there are plans to implement it in JavaScript and Python.
